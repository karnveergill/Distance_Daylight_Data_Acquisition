This C code is written to run on a TI TM4C123G Launchpad Micro-controller.  Nothing is done inside main besides initiallizing ports and then everything else in the software is done by interrupts.

There is code written to interface with and ultrasonic sensor by sending a trigger signal and then timing the response signal from the ultrasonic device to determine distance. 

There is code written to use the ADC on the TI Launchpad in order to read voltage values from a photo resistor and determine whether it is light or dark near the device.  

There is code written to set up two of the UARTs on the TI Launchpad. One of these UARTs interfaces with a bluetooth module and allows for data to transmitted from the bluetooth module at the Micro-controller to a serial terminal on my computer.  There is a second UART configured to send the same data but via serial communication to a second TI Launchpad which uses the information to trigger LED's on the second board.
